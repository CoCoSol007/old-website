# My Website.
I created this website in two parts:

- Front end: HTML/JavaScript/Tailwins
- Back end: Rust using Rocket

# Features
Currently, the project is in development, but you can:

- Post articles (upload Markdown)

In the future, you will be able to:

- Link Git projects with the website and post articles about them
- Modify existing articles
